	algebra
	-------------------------------
	Algebra is about finding the unknown or putting real life variables into equations and then solving them. 
	Algebra is a branch of mathematics that substitutes letters for numbers, and an algebraic equation represents a scale where what is done on one side of the scale is also done to the other side of the scale and the numbers act as constants. 
	Algebra can include real numbers, complex numbers, matrices, vectors, and many more forms of mathematic representation.

	The 4 Math Skills for Machine Learning
(I) Statistics and Probability
Statistics and Probability is used for visualization of features, data preprocessing, feature transformation, data imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, model evaluation, etc. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with:
	1. Mean
	2. Median
	3. Mode
	4. Standard deviation/variance
	5. Correlation coefficient and covariance matrix
	6. Probabilty distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal)
	7. p value
	8. Baye’s Theorem (Precision, Recall, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve)
	9. A/B Testing
	10. Monte Carlo Simulation
(II) Multivariable Calculus
Most machine learning models are built with a data set having several features or predictors. Hence familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important for building a machine learning model. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with:
	1. Functions of several variables
	2. Derivatives and gradients
	3. Step function, Sigmoid function, Logit function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function
	4. Cost function
	5. Plotting of functions
	6. Minimum and Maximum values of a function
(III) Linear Algebra
Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine machine. A data set is represented as a matrix. Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing, data transformation, and model evaluation. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with:
	1. Vectors
	2. Matrices
	3. Transpose of a matrix
	4. Inverse of a matrix
	5. Determinant of a matrix
	6. Dot product
	7. Eigenvalues
	8. Eigenvectors
(IV) Optimization Methods
Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective function, thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order to obtain the predicted labels. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with:
	1. Cost function/Objective function
	2. Likelihood function
	3. Error function
	4. Gradient Descent Algorithm and its variants (e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm)

Partial differentiation is used to differentiate mathematical functions having more than one variable in them. In ordinary differentiation, we find derivative with respect to one variable only, as function contains only one variable. 
Partial differentiation is used for finding maxima and minima in optimization problems
